## 📰 Key Developments

&nbsp;

*Important announcements and updates from the Solana ecosystem*

&nbsp;


### 1. Solana Global Hackathon Registration Reaches 7,500 Founders

7,500 founders from 134 countries have registered for the global Solana hackathon as of October 24, 2025

💡 **Why this matters:** Large developer influx may result in new dApp integrations and wallet feature requests from hackathon projects

&nbsp;

### 2. Solana Network Capacity Doubling Expected by Year-End

Planned upgrades are expected to double Solana network's capacity by year-end. Solana native applications generated $3 billion in revenue in the past year

💡 **Why this matters:** Network capacity doubling will affect transaction throughput handling and may require wallet infrastructure scaling

&nbsp;

### 3. Phantom Launches MEGA-USD Perpetuals with 3x Leverage

MEGA-USD (MegaETH) perpetuals are now live in Phantom wallet with up to 3x leverage. Not available in all jurisdictions

💡 **Why this matters:** Demonstrates wallet evolution into DeFi trading interfaces; perpetuals integration represents new wallet functionality paradigm

&nbsp;

### 4. P-Token Implementation Progress Update

P-Token has 5 remaining steps before deployment: 1) Formal Verification completion, 2) Potential validator vote on SIMD 266, 3) SIMD 266 acceptance, 4) P-Token feature in deployed cluster, 5) P-Token activation

💡 **Why this matters:** New token standard will require wallet support implementation; monitor SIMD 266 for technical specifications

&nbsp;

### 5. Alpenglow Consensus Model Evolution Ongoing

Alpenglow was announced earlier in 2025 as the evolution of Solana's consensus model. Mechanisms are still being discussed and decided

💡 **Why this matters:** Consensus changes may affect transaction finality times and wallet confirmation logic

&nbsp;

### 6. Anchor Security Bounty Program Launched with $100k Maximum

Solana Foundation launched security bounty program for Anchor framework. Rewards: High impact (bypassing core checks, ownership, discriminators, memory safety): $10K-$100K; Medium impact (DoS): $5K-$25K; Low impact: $100-$5K. Program focuses on Anchor framework bugs, not individual protocol mistakes

💡 **Why this matters:** Indicates priority security areas for Solana development; wallets interacting with Anchor programs should monitor disclosed vulnerabilities

&nbsp;

### 7. Ore Protocol 10x Revenue Growth in One Month

Ore protocol increased its revenue by 10x in a month on Solana network

💡 **Why this matters:** Rapid protocol growth may drive increased user demand for wallet integration with Ore
