### 2. Solana Network Capacity to Double by Year-End

Planned upgrades are expected to double Solana network's capacity by year-end. Native applications generated $3 billion in revenue in the past year

**Why this matters:** Network capacity doubling will impact transaction throughput and may require wallet infrastructure upgrades to handle increased transaction volume

### 4. P-Token Protocol Update Progress

P-Token is progressing with 5 remaining steps: 1) Formal Verification completion, 2) Potential validator vote on SIMD 266, 3) SIMD 266 acceptance, 4) P-Token feature in deployed cluster, 5) P-Token activation

**Why this matters:** P-Token implementation via SIMD 266 will require wallet developers to integrate new token standard functionality

**Why this matters:** Anchor framework security improvements will enhance safety of dApps that wallets interact with; wallet developers should monitor security updates
